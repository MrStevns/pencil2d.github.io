#### Selection/Move tool improvements

It's been on our TODO list for a long time but this release is finally where we got around to fix one obnoxious problem about the move tool. The fact that when you rotate a selection, the selection visual itself doesn't change. Fixing this problem however required reworking a lot of the selection logic but doing so also allowed us to fix a bunch of other annoying bugs, while also being able to improve the user experience.


| Old                        | New                                              |

A few quality of life improvements that this gave birth to:

Previously when you had created a selection and moved your object without deselecting and wanting to change layer, you would get a blocking dialog, requiring you to deny or accept the current transformation.

<img width="532" alt="image" src="https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil2d.github.io/assets/1045397/924f9a04-b6ef-4949-a8bf-3eda888f7066">

Now because of the reworked logic, this is no longer neccesary and we can instead just apply the change immediately and change layer.

In addition to that every transform will also now be undo'able.
